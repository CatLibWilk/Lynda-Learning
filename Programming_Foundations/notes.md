# Chpt. 1 OO Fundamentals

# Inheritance
- Have one class with attributes common to other classes, the other classes will inherit from the common class, and have attributes unique to them defined in own class (superclass vs. subclass)
# Polymorphism
- dynamic polymorphism: use same interface for methods on different types of objects
    - inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces are different implementations of d-polymorphism
- static/compile-time polymorphism
    -  utilizes `method overloading`: implementing multiple methods in same class with same name, but different sets of input params

- OO analysis, design, and programming
    - analysis and design occur before code writing (what you need to do and how you'll do it)
    - typical 5-step approach: gather reqs, describe the app, ID main objects, describe the interactions, create class diagram

- Unified Modeling Language (UML)
    - standardized notation for diagrams to visualize OO systems

# Chpt. 2 Defining Requirements
- First set of reqs should be the `musts` and `shoulds`, functional and non-functional requirements, not necessarily all the features that would be nice to have
    - just those required for a minimum viable product
- FURPS requirements
    - Functionality, Useability, Reliability, Performance and Supportability
