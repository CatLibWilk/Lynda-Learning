## Chpt. 1
- 3 Types of Design Patterns 
    - creational: used to create objects in systematic way
        - main benefit is flexibility
        - frequently relies on polymorphism
    - structural: establish useful relationships between software components in certain configs
        - takes advantage of inheritance
    - behavioral: best practices of object interaction
        - relies on methods and their signatures 
    - interfaces are used across all these types of patterns

- inheritance
    - establishes parent/child relationship between two classes
        - child keeps methods/attributes of the parent
        - can add new methods/attributes
        - can override parent attrib/methods

- polymorphism: define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class
    - relies on inheritance
    - allows child classes to be instantiated and treated as same type as parent
    - enables parent class to be manifested into any of its child classes
    - If a child class object is used to call an overridden method then the child class version of the method is called. On the other hand, if parent class object is used to call an overridden method, then the parent class version of the method is called.

- Pattern context
    - participants: classes in design pattern
    - quality attributes: non-functional reqs
    - forces: factors or trade-offs, manifested in quality attributes
    - consequences

## Chpt. 2 - Creational Patterns
- 1. Factory
    - encapsulates object creation
    - useful when uncertain about type of objects needed, or when decisions about what classes to use occur at runtime
    - ex. 
        class Shape(object):
            # Create based on class name:
            def factory(type):
                #return eval(type + "()")
                if type == "Circle": return Circle()
                if type == "Square": return Square()
                assert 0, "Bad shape creation: " + type
            factory = staticmethod(factory)

        class Circle(Shape):
            def draw(self): print("Circle.draw")
            def erase(self): print("Circle.erase")

        class Square(Shape):
            def draw(self): print("Square.draw")
            def erase(self): print("Square.erase")

        # Generate shape name strings:
        def shapeNameGen(n):
            types = Shape.__subclasses__()
            for i in range(n):
                yield random.choice(types).__name__

        shapes = \
        [ Shape.factory(i) for i in shapeNameGen(7)]
            - so calling Shape.factory(i) where i is the shape name yielded from the generator will produce an list of created circle and square objects

        for shape in shapes:
            shape.draw()
            shape.erase()

- 2. Abstract factories (exfiles 2_04)
    - user expects family of related objects at runtime, but doesn't know which family until runtime

- 3. Singleton: object-oriented way of providing global variables (exfiles 2_06)
    - allow only one object to be instantiated from a class
    - can act as cache of info to be shared by various objects in system, so dont have to retrieve from source every time

- 4. Builder (exfiles 2_08)
    - design pattern solution to 'telescoping constructor' anti-pattern
        - ie. problem occuring when trying to build complex object with excessive number of constructors
    - partitions building a complex object into 4 different roles
        - director  
        - abstract builder (Provides interfaces)
        - concrete builder (implements interfaces)
        - product - represents actual object being built

- 5. Prototype(exfiles 2_10)
    - clones objects according to prototypical instance
        - useful for creating many identical objects individually
    - make class Prototype with 4 methods
        - one instantiating an object dict, two to add/remove objects to dict with name argument as key
        - another to clone using imported module `copy` as `copy.deepcopy(self._objects.get(name))` [`where self._objects is dict created in __init__ method at top`]

# Structural Patterns

- 6. Decorators (3_02)
    - adds additional features to existing function
    - uses `@` symbol

- 7. Proxy (3_04)
    - useful when dealing with resource-intensive object
    - goal is to postpone object creation until absolutely necessary
    - need for placehold that creates object if necessary
    - clients interact with proxy object until resource-intensive object becomes available

- 8 Adapter(3_06)
    - adapts interface of class into one the client is expecting
        - usage ex.: incompatible interface between client and server
    - can have individualized method names in classes that do the same thing, running through adapter could generalize them
        - e.g. speak_english(), speak_korean() ==> speak()

- 9 Composite(3_08)
    - maintains tree data structure to represent part/whole relationships
    - ex. = creating menu and submenu items
    - three parts: 
        - Component: abstract class
        - Child: concrete class inheriting from component
        - Composite: concrete class inheriting from component

- 10 Bridge(3_10): helps deal with complicated class hierarchy, esp. when implementation-specific classes are mixed with implementation-independent ones
    - want to separate the abstractions into two class hierarchies
    - n.b. dont really get it. see: https://www.giacomodebidda.com/bridge-pattern-in-python/

# Behavioral Patterns
- 11 Observer(4_02): est 1:n relationship between subject object and many observer objects
    - when change occurs in subject, registered observers need to be notified 
    - often used for the specific case of changes based on other objectâ€™s change of state, but is also the basis of event management.
    - `subject` is the thing being observered, and it holds the list of things observing it (ie. `self._observers = []` to start)
        - will have add and remove functions for dealing with observers, and also the notify function (observed objects notify  observers when something occurs)
        - a concrete class will inherit from the abstract `Subject` class, and will have getters and setters for values.  Setter will make change and call notify() function inherited from Subject
        - an object based on an observing class will have some updating function that gets called in the Subject class' notify() function

- 12 Visitor (4_04): add new features to existing class hierarchy without changing it (ie. adding new operations dynamically with minimal change)
    - has class for thing being visited, with `accept` method that accepts a visitor and calls a `visit` method defined by the Visitor.  this `visit` method in-turn calls a method defined in the `visited` class 

- 13 Iterator (4_06): allows client sequential access to elements of aggregate object without exposing underlying structure
    - isolates access and traversal feature of an aggregreate obj and tracks objects being traversed.

- 14 Strategy (4_08): offers family of interchangeable algorithms to a client
    - there is often a need for dynamically changing the behavior of an object.
        - so strategy class is offered with default behavior, and then when needed, another variation of strategy offered by dynamically replacing default method with new one.
        - abstract strategy class with default behaviors, concrete strategy classes with new behaviors
        - requires `types` module from python library
        -   ```if function:
        	        self.execute = types.MethodType(function, self)```
            used to say that "if a reference to a function is provided, replace the `execute` function in this class with the passed in function"

- 15 Chain of Responsibility (4_10): allows for different possibilities of processing for a request
    - decouples request and its processing
    - define a series of handlers that each determine if they can process the request before (if cant) pushing it on to `successor` handler
