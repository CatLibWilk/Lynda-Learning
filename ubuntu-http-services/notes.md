## Chpt. 1 Apache HTTP Server
- a web server needs a static IP address and domain name.
- Apache configuration
    - config files at `etc/apache2`
    - `apache2.conf` is main config file
    - on ubuntu, configuration is broken out into several files:  
        - main config = `apache2.conf`
        - individual site configs = `sites-available` folder
            -  use `a2ensite` and `a2dissite` to enable/disable sites
- Apache Directives
    - used in .conf file to determine how the server or hosts function
    - common sections
        - <VirtualHost> = defines a virtualhost
        - <IfModule> = tests for presence of module
        - <FilesMatch> = tells system to reach in certain way in response to requests for files matching a certain regex or condition
            - often used as handler for a particular type of file
        - <Directory> = sets parameters for given directory on server
            - inside will frequently include directives like Options, AllowOverride, Require, etc.
    - common directives
        - `Options`: sets parameter that a directory will be allowed to support 
        - `AllowOverride`: set features that can be overridden by later configurations like htaccess
        - `Require`: allow views to access/not access a given folder
        - `Include`: loads another file
        - `DocumentRoot`: root folder that apache will serve up
    - Name-based VirtualHosts
        - allows several websites to have the same IP address
        - setup:
            - at `etc/apache2/sites-available`, copy `000-default.conf and rename for your site
            - set `ServerName` to match the domain that will point to the IP address
            - set `DocumentRoot` for directory that apache should serve
            - run cmd `a2ensite [conf_file_name]` and `service apache2 reload`
