## Analytical Writing Assessment
- will be an arguement and issue essay (2 essays)
- can access pool of example essays on GRE website
- coming up with theses
    - should chose nuanced argument, not totally aggree or disaggree with statment. 

- coming up with examples to support argument
    - dont need specialized knowledge of topic
    - rather than try to come up with the perfect example, start with what you know and see how it might apply
    - beforehand: create list of your go-to topics that coan later be applied to several essays

- argument essay flaws
    - go sentance by sentance and see what can be questioned
    - get 3 or 4 topics from argument to question, and write a paragraph about the implications of each

- grammar/writing mechanics
    - vary sentance structure, use complex sentances

## Quantatative Reasoning Sections
- GRE website has Math Review section giving concepts that will be on the test 
- 4 main categories: arithmatic, geometric, algebra, data analysis
- building math concepts
    - because the questions are often less about actual math and more about the reasoning aspect, need to have good foundations in the math concepts being presented 
    - use GRE Math Review online (GRE website)
    - Cliffnotes: Math Review for Standardized Tests
- Quantatative Comparison Technique
    - pick A/B if either will always be greater, C if equal, D if cant tell
    - test with `1`, `0`, `-1`
    - dont have to do the math always, can get by thinking logically
        - eg.  
            (a-b)^6 vs a^6 - b^6 where a=3 and b=-5  
            even integer exponents will always be positive, so 1st one is some number to the 6th, where the second is some number minus a large number, ie. 1st will always be bigger
