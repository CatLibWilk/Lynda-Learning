# Software Development Lifecycle

## Chpt. 1 Traditional Methods
- Waterfall Method
    - steps
        - Gather Reqs
        - Analysis and Design
        - Development
        - Test
        - Development and Maintainance 
    - disadvantages
        - late stage delivery of business value
            - customer only gets to see 2/3 way through dev process
- Spiral Model
    - first iterative approach model
    - series of waterfalls with 4 parts: planning, risk analysis, engineering, evaluation
- Rational Unified Process (RUP)
    - 4 phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition
        - each consists of a waterfall-like iterative process ending in a `milestone`

## Chpt 2. Early Agile Forms
- FDD (Feature Driven Design) Steps:
    - Develop overall model
    - build feature list
    - plan by feature
    - design by feature
    - build by feature
